        <p>Four Ferry classes service Staten Island:  Kennedy, Barberi, Austen and Molinari.  The scenic 5 mile journey across the harbor takes roughly 22 minutes at 15 knots. Around 75 thousand people take the ferry  every workday. Mixed in with the commuters are the tourist that flock to the Ferry, it's New York's best bargain. The boat has a Brooklyn side and a New Jersey side. On the Jersey side is the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Both of which greeted the mil-lions of immigrants that arrived in New York.On the Brooklyn side is the East river with a distant view of the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. Also seen on the journey are: Govenors Island, the exhaust tower for the Brooklyn  Battery tunnel, and The Verrazano Bridge. The free ride and views of the lower harbor from the ferry is a big attraction. And the Statue of liberty is the standout. She is the most photo-graphed statue in the world.</p>

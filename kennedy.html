        <p>Kennedy
The Kennedy class once consisted of 3 boats: The Governor Herbert H. Lehman, The American Legion and The John F. Kennedy. Today only the Kennedy is in service. 
The Lehman was cannibalized for parts and used to maintain the Kennedy. She was decommissioned in 2007 and auctioned in 2008 for $152,500 to the La Viviana Industries Inc in the Bronx. It is currently docked for renovations at Steelways Shipyard in Newburgh, NY. 
The American Legion was sold for scrap to a Virginia Beach-based Sea Solutions for $49,999.99. Was american legion used for spare parts like the Lehman?
These boats were built in 1960&#8217s by the Levingston Shipbuilding company of Orange, Texas and cost what?.
Kennedy is 227 feet long, has a gross tonnage of 2109, and can accommodate 3,533 passengers on its' 3 decks and nearly 40 vehicles (Since 9/11 vehicles are not allowed to board.) Many feel a ride on the Kennedy is the richest, with sliding doors, wooden seats and an outside deck. They possess a tradition that the Barberi and Austin class lacks.

    <p>Alice Austen (1866 - 1952) was one of America's earliest and most prolific female photographers, and over the course of her life she captured about 8,000 images.</p>
    
    <p>Aside from being a woman in a man's field, what made Austen singular as an early photographer was her pursuit of action shots, not just studio portraits. Though she is best known for her documentary work, Austen was an artist with a strong aesthetic sensibility. Furthermore, she was a landscape designer, a master tennis player, and the first woman on Staten Island to own a car.</p> 
    <p>She never married, and instead spent 50 years with Gertrude Tate.  A rebel who broke away from the ties of her Victorian environment, Alice Austen created her own independent life.</p>
    <p>The Stock Market crash of 1929 wiped out Austen's inheritance. In 1945, a bankrupt Austen and Tate were evicted from Clear Comfort. Tate was taken in by her sister. Austen, arthritic and in a wheelchair, was rediscovered at the lowly Staten Island Farm Colony and given an exhibition in 1951, a year before she died at 86.</p> 
    <p>The Staten Island Historical Society at Historic Richmond owns over 7,000 original items (glass plate negatives, film base negatives, and original prints) by Alice Austen. This collection is cataloged, digitized, and stored in an archival manner at Historic Richmond Town, and it is available for study by appointment. The Alice Austen House Museum also has a collection of photographs. And about 300 are on display in the resource room, which is open to the public.</p>

    <p>Born in Paris in 1913, John A. Noble is the son of the noted American painter, John "Wichita Bill" Noble.  He spent his early years in the studios of his father and his father's contemporaries, innovative artists and writers of the early part of this century.  He moved with his family to this country in 1919</p>
    <p>A graduate of the Friends Seminary in New York City, Noble returned to France in 1931, where he studied for one year at the University of Grenoble. There he met his wife and lifetime companion, "the lovely, green-eyed" Susan Ames.</p>
    <p>Port Johnston was "the largest graveyard of wooden sailing vessels in the world." Filled with new but obsolete ships, the great coalport had become a great boneyard. In 1941, Noble began to build his floating studio there, out of parts of vessels he salvaged and from 1946 on, he worked as a full-time artist, setting off from his studio in a rowboat to explore the Harbor.</p>
